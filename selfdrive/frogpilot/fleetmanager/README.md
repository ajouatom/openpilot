# Fleet Manager

Fleet Manger on openpilot allows viewing dashcam footage, screen recordings, error logs and on-device navigation by connecting to the comma device via the same network, with your mobile device or PC. Big thanks to [actuallylemoncurd](https://github.com/actuallylemoncurd), [AlexandreSato](https://github.com/alexandreSato), [ntegan1](https://github.com/ntegan1), [royjr](https://github.com/royjr), [sunnyhaibin] (https://github.com/sunnypilot), [dragonpilot](https://github.com/dragonpilot-community) and [chatgpt](https://chat.openai.com/).

The network can be set up by Wi-Fi, mobile hotspot, or tethering on the comma device. Navigate to http://ipAddress:8082 to access.
