- Navigation deceleration behavior for the `origin/thftgr/navi-stream` branch is documented in
  `docs/carrot_navi_7713_7714_deceleration.md`.
- The 7714-only control comparison between `origin/carrot-wip` and `origin/thftgr/navi-stream` is
  documented in `docs/carrot_navi_7714_branch_comparison.md`.
- When changing the UDP 7713 legacy navigation path, TCP 7714 Carrot Navi v2 path, shared
  `CarrotServ` speed selection, or the on-road/cluster speed-source UI, update that document and
  the focused tests together.
- Both `origin/carrot-wip` and `origin/thftgr/navi-stream` evaluate a new 7714 speed item before
  assigning the current `lane_current.road_category`. A present lane item without that key becomes
  category 0. This can suppress primary SDI type 22 (`xSpdType=-1`) even though raw 7714 UI shows it;
  7713 assigns `roadcate` before `_update_sdi()` and does not have this ordering failure.
- The `origin/thftgr/navi-stream` cluster road-camera/map flicker analysis is documented in
  `docs/cluster_road_camera_map_flicker_analysis.md`. The hardware H.264 map and TICI road camera
  both use `samplerExternalOES` on texture unit 0; each external image must be rebound immediately
  before every draw, not only when its source frame changes.
